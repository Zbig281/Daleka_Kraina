Transfer all content to the server.

you must remove all .cs.dso otherwise the server won't read current .cs

But only those included in the Daleka_Kraina_MOD package

such as: Animals.cs , Transport.cs and more.


How to create them yourself?

use the command:

"/ANIMAL tribebdata" ,

"/ANIMAL tribedata" ,

"/ANIMAL tribehdata" ,

"/ANIMAL tribemdata" ,
